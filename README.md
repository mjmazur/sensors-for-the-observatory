# sensors-for-the-observatory

This project describes an Arduino temperature and humidity logger used to monitor the EMCCD meteor cameras at the UWO observatories.

The humidity sensors are DHT11 or DHT22 while the temperture probes are sealed one-wire sensors. One humidity and one temperature sensor is placed inside of each EMCCD enclosure while additional sensors monitor the temperature of the chiller fluid and the ambient temperature of the camera shed.
